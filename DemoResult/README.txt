To valiate the versatility of the pipeline. We conducted test runs on four demo BGCs and generated four xlsx files as outputs. Four demos are:
1. Bacterial_cellulose
2. Bacterial_microcompartments
3. Covalently_linked_pili
4. Gas_Vesicle
You can find relevant input files in corresponding directories, Covalently_linked_pili could be a good example to start running with if you're not sure what to do with this pipeline
